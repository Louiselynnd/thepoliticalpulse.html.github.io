              <h2>Is This The End For Trump? Decisions By The Colorado Supreme Court Puts Trump's Future At Risk</h2>
              <div class="header5">
              <h5>Key points from the unprecedented ruling by the Colorado Supreme Court disqualifiying Trump from the 2024 ballot</h5>
              <div class ="imagetrump">
                <image src="https://assets2.cbsnewsstatic.com/hub/i/r/2023/12/20/fe9c0ef2-6cdb-4f75-b50c-3de210a2f091/thumbnail/1280x720/27b0cd9926605eb27ab84021c0138db0/cbsn-fusion-trump-disqualified-from-ballot-in-colorado-thumbnail.jpg?v=5382e209c94ee904b3a96a69f8ca0ce0 alt="trump" width="500" height="280"></image></div>
              <div class="paragraph">
              <p>On December 19, 2023, under the Constitutionâ€™s insurrection clause, the Colorado Supreme Court ruled that Donald Trump, the former president of the United States of America, was disbarred from participating in the 2024 US presidential election. Moreover, the Secretary of State was commanded to eliminate Trumpâ€™s name from the stateâ€™s Republican presidential primary ballot.</p>
              <p>â€œWe conclude that because President Trump is disqualified from holding the presidency under Section Three of the Amendment, it would be a wrongful act under the Election Code for the Secretary to list President Trump as a candidate on the presidential primary ballot." "Therefore, the Secretary may not list President Trump's name on the 2024 presidential primary ballot, nor may she count any write-in votes cast for him,â€ as said by the majority of the court.</p>
              <p>According to the Colorado Supreme Court, there was substantial evidence proving that Trump undertook insurrection, hence the basis of their decision. The significant decision explaining that Trump will be unable to occupy public office, made by the Colorado Supreme Court under the provisions of the Civil War-era, is deemed unprecedented. For the first time, a state court has decided that Trump ought to be disqualified from the 2024 race due to his support of the uprising aimed at reversing his defeat to Democratic candidate Joe Biden in the 2020 election. Throughout history, there has never been a case where a court, under the clause in Section 3 of the 14th Amendment, resolved that a presidential candidate was not eligible. Additionally, in November 2023, the trial judge in Colorado concluded that despite Trumpâ€™s role in an insurrection, â€œthe insurrectionist banâ€ in Section 3 of the 14th Amendment is inapplicable to the presidency.</p>
              <div class="imagetrump">
                <image src="https://coloradonewsline.com/wp-content/uploads/2023/12/trump-supreme-court-boatright-2048x1365.jpg"alt="supreme court" width="480" height="300"></image></div>
              <p>Justices of the state high court, who were appointed by Democratic governors, postponed their decision until January 4, 2024, one day before Colorado Secretary of State, Jena Griswold, had to certify the candidates for the state's March 5 primary. The ruling is not applicable outside of Colorado.</p>
              <p>The Colorado Supreme Court postponed its ruling, stating that the secretary is required to include Trump on the 2024 primary ballot until the U.S. Supreme Court rules and that the stay would remain in effect if review by the country's highest court is requested before January 4.</p>
              <p>Donald Trumpâ€™s future as the potential president of the United States for 2025 could easily be shattered if the decision made by the Supreme Court of Colorado successfully follows through.</p>

      <h2>Is this Indonesia's Most Intense Presidential Election? Indonesia's First Presidential Debate Shifts Voters' Choice</h2> 
        <div class="header5">
          <h5>Highlights Of The First Three Topics Covered In The First Debate of Presidential Candidates for the 2024 Indonesian Election</h5>
           <div class ="imagedebate">
             <image src="https://www.benarnews.org/english/news/indonesian/debate-details-12122023165032.html/@@images/8027825b-30f6-4cd5-9a1f-315142de110d.jpeg" alt="Debate" width="500" height="300"></image></div>
              <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>On December 14, 2023, the candidates of the Indonesian Presidential Election, Anies Baswedan, Prabowo Subianto, and Ganjar Pranowo, participated in the First Debate of Presidential Candidates for the 2024 Election.</p> 
                  <p>During the debate, Anies Baswedan, the former governor of Jakarta, stated the importance of refining and enhancing the Indonesian legal system. Prabowo Subianto, the Indonesian minister of defense, emphasized the significance of defending human rights, reinforcing laws, and endorsing peace and democracy in the country. Ganjar Pranowo, the former governor of Central Java, highlighted the value of accessible healthcare and education.</p>
                  <p>The debate covered critical issues, beginning with the strategies the candidates would propose concerning the ongoing conflicts and human rights issues in Papua. Prabowoâ€™s answer circulated around the idea of straightening the laws in Papua. Rebutting Prabowoâ€™s response, Ganjar stressed the participation of Papuan people in the decision-making processes. Additionally, Anies added that the actual problem is the lack of equality in Papua and that justice must be presented, not the absence of violence, to prevent a recurrence. Therefore, he proposed that action be taken to resolve every incident of human rights violations that occurs. Moreover, Prabowo agrees with the approach of dialogue and the importance of equality but emphasizes the difficulty of carrying out Aniesâ€™ solution.</p> 
                  <p>The debate then moved on to the issue of the public service index remaining stagnant, despite legal frameworks that promote equality, and thus raised the question of the programs the candidate would propose to improve public service quality and ensure justice, particularly for vulnerable groups like women, children, and people with disabilities. Ganjar promoted discussion boards and a complaint app for government accountability in order to give voice to marginalized groups. Anies added deadlines for the resolution of issues, while Prabowo expressed concerns regarding fertilizer scarcity, particularly due to the farmer card Ganjar established during his time as Jakartaâ€™s governor. In defense, Ganjar argued that fertilizer scarcity is a nationwide problem.</p>
                  <image src="https://cdn1-production-images-kly.akamaized.net/wG1BPCHusGkZTuQ0zUtKh62jV1A=/1280x720/smart/filters:quality(75):strip_icc():format(webp)/kly-media-production/medias/4684000/original/003651800_1702399688-20231212-Momen_Akhir_Debat_Perdana-FAI_2.jpg" alt="debate" width="500" height="300"></image></div>
                  <div class="paragraph">
                  <p>The topic of violent persecution and discrimination cases was also brought up, allowing the candidates to share their policy to protect citizens and strengthen tolerance in a pluralistic Indonesian society. Aniesâ€™ proposed legal punishment for lawbreakers, increasing freedom of speech by encouraging effective communication, and developing an app that offers free legal service. Ganjar emphasized religious leaders imparting moral education, while Prabowo expressed concerns regarding minority groups facing obstacles in establishing places of worship due to bureaucracy. Anies assured, based on his previous actions as governor of Jakarta, that he would give permission.</p>
                  <p>The candidates' perspectives on Indonesia's future were made clear during the first debate. Ganjar prioritized healthcare and education; Prabowo concentrated on protecting human rights; and Anies focused on legal reforms. Each candidate offers a different and unique solution to deal with challenges occurring in the country, and as the election unravels, voters will carefully examine these stances to make informed decisions for their country's future.</p>

                <div class="paragraph">
                <p>On December 20, 2023, Xi Jinping, the President of the Peopleâ€™s Republic Of China engaged in a meeting with Mikhail Mishutin, the Prime Minister Of Russia in Beijing.</p>
                <p>The governments, legislative bodies, political parties, and localities of the two countries have conducted in-depth exchanges, and rational partnership across multiple sectors in a sound and steady manner, according to Xi, who noted his meeting with President Putin twice since the beginning of this year.</p>
                <p>Over the course of the first 11 months in 2023, the trade of the two countries has accumulated to a value of $218.2 billion US dollars. Hence, exceeding the goal President Xi and President Putin settled on in 2018, which was to reach $200 billion in bilateral trade volume. This demonstrated the board prospects and solid resilience for mutually advantageous collaboration between the two nations. Moreover, President Xi also highlighted that the continuous development and maintenance of China and Russiaâ€™s relationship serves as a strategic decision formed by both sides based on the essential concerns of the two countries.</p>
                <p>In addition, the 75th anniversary of the diplomatic relations between the two nations occurs in 2024. President Xi urges that in order to create a human community with a shared future, the parties must, at this fresh start, strengthen the beneficial effects of high-level political relations and work together to advance the comprehensive promotion of socioeconomic development and the national revival of their respective countries.</p>
                <p>Additionally, Xi encouraged both parties to fully utilize the benefits of political mutual trust,  infrastructure connectivity, economic complementarity, and people-to-people interactions; consistently enhance the meaning of cooperation; intensify cooperation in the areas of commerce, energy, and the economy; and collaboratively uphold the security and stability of supply chains and the industrial sector.</p>
                <p>On top of that, this year, trade and economic cooperation have advanced to a new level after overcoming challenging obstacles. Nearly 18 trillion roubles, or 1.5 trillion Chinese yuan, were exchanged between parties. It is also significant to note that over 90% of the transactions between the two nations were conducted in yuan or rubles, indicating that they have almost entirely switched to using their national currencies in mutual transactions. Furthermore, investments have yielded positive results; 80 cooperative projects worth nearly 20 trillion roubles, or roughly 1.6 trillion yuan, are presently underway.</p>
                <p>Aside from that, Prime Minister Mikhail Mishutin also conveyed his deepest condolences for the loss of life inflicted by the destructive earthquake located in the Gansu and Qinghai provinces earlier in December 2023. He also added that as decided by President Putin, Russia is willing and ready to assist in mitigating the consequences of the earthquake, if the Chinese government requests it. </p>
                <p>The meeting between President Xi and Prime Minister Mikhail Mishutin has successfully reflected on the numerous benefits collected due to the partnership between Russia and China, while explaining the advantages for continuous cooperation between the two parties.</p>

                <div class = "paragraph">
                <p>On December 8, 2023, President Vladimir Putin announced that he would run for re-election in 2024 at an award ceremony for army forces in Kremlin, Russia, for the office of president of the Russian Federation. </p>
                <p>After winning four presidential elections and briefly holding the position of Russiaâ€™s prime minister, the 71-year-old leader has successfully led Russia to immense success and development in all sectors, including defense, healthcare, etc. Putin has the right to continue his role as Russiaâ€™s president until at least 2026, due to the controversial constitutional reform created in 2020. </p>
                <p>The media has reported that the leaders of the Russian government are in favor of Putinâ€™s decisions and have spoken pleasantly regarding his actions as President of Russia. Moreover, Lieutenant Colonel Artyom Zhoga, a Russian military officer, said, â€œWe allâ€”I say this with confidenceâ€”in the reunited territories, all of Russia, support him. We are very happy that he heard our request.â€</p>
                <p>According to analysts, there is nearly a 100% chance that Putin will win the 2024 election, as no major contenders are available in his bid for a fifth term, and Putin will probably aim for the largest mandate possible to conceal internal divisions regarding the situation in Ukraine. The submission of a candidate for the 2024 presidential election from the five primary parties has been allowed under the condition of not collecting signatures. Aside from that, all candidates also support the Kremlin, along with the current offensive in Ukraine. </p>

                <p>As far as the process for the 2024 election goes on, Alexei Navalny, Putinâ€™s most competent rival, is currently serving his time behind bars for 19 years over charges that his supporters claim are false. Furthermore, Navalny recently issued a statement to the press with the help of his team, urging Russians to vote for any other candidate apart from Putin. He also mocked the electoral procedure by calling it a â€œparody.â€</p>
